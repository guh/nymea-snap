summary: An open source IoT server
description: | 
  The nymea daemon is a plugin based IoT (Internet of Things) server. 
  The server works like a translator for devices, things and services 
  and allows them to interact. With the powerful rule engine you are 
  able to connect any device available in the system and create individual 
  scenes and behaviors for your environment.
